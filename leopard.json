      "The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is a subspecies of leopard native to the island of Sri Lanka in South Asia. Recognized for its distinct and vibrant coat, the Sri Lankan leopard is characterized by its golden-yellow fur marked with dark rosettes and spots. This elusive big cat is a top predator in its ecosystem and is known for its adaptability to various habitats, ranging from dense rainforests to grasslands and scrublands. The Sri Lankan leopard's slender and agile build enables it to navigate through diverse terrains with ease.",
      "While sharing some similarities with other leopard subspecies, the Sri Lankan leopard exhibits certain unique features, including a slightly smaller size compared to its African counterparts. Adult males typically weigh between 60 to 90 kilograms, while females are generally smaller. The species is known for its solitary nature, and individuals establish territories to avoid competition for resources. Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan leopard faces conservation challenges, primarily due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Efforts are underway to protect and preserve these magnificent big cats, including initiatives to safeguard their natural habitats and promote coexistence between local communities and wildlife."

        "image": "./Images/leopard skin.jpg",
        "description": "The poaching of leopards represents a grave and persistent threat to the survival of these majestic big cats in the wild. Driven by illicit markets and traditional beliefs, poachers target leopards for their prized skins, bones, and other body parts. The illegal wildlife trade values leopard skins for their exquisite patterns, while various body parts are erroneously sought after for their supposed medicinal or mystical properties. Trophy hunting exacerbates the problem, contributing to the decline of leopard populations. In regions where human-wildlife conflict is prevalent, farmers may resort to retaliatory killings of leopards perceived as threats to livestock. The insidious impact of poaching not only decimates leopard numbers but also disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems, affecting biodiversity at large. Conservation efforts are essential to combat poaching, encompassing rigorous law enforcement, community engagement, and education to dismantle the demand for leopard products and foster coexistence between humans and these crucial predators. The fight against leopard poaching is integral to preserving the rich biodiversity of the ecosystems they inhabit and securing a sustainable future for these iconic big cats."

        "description": "Infrastructure development poses significant challenges to leopard populations, creating a range of problems that impact their habitats and overall well-being. Roads, highways, and urban expansion associated with infrastructure projects can fragment and encroach upon the natural landscapes where leopards roam. Increased human activity in these areas often leads to higher incidents of vehicle collisions with leopards, resulting in injuries or fatalities for these elusive big cats. Moreover, the expansion of infrastructure facilitates easier access for poachers seeking leopard skins and body parts, contributing to the illegal wildlife trade. The disruption caused by construction and human settlements can displace leopards from their territories, leading to conflicts with local communities as these apex predators search for food sources. Conservation efforts must address the intricate relationship between infrastructure development and leopard conservation, striving to implement measures that mitigate habitat fragmentation, enhance wildlife corridors, and minimize human-wildlife conflicts. Balancing the need for progress with the preservation of essential habitats is crucial to securing a sustainable future for leopard populations in the face of ongoing infrastructure development."
